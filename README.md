﻿Implement a function FolderNames, which accepts a string 
containing an XML file that specifies folder structure and 
returns all folder names that start with startingLetter. 

The XML format is given in the example below.

For example, for the letter 'u' and XML file:

		<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
		<folder name="c">
			<folder name="program files">
				<folder name="uninstall information" />
			</folder>
			<folder name="users" />
		</folder>

the function should return "uninstall information" and "users" (in any order).
